# Technical University of Crete - HPY414 - Assignment 3

This is an assignment I completed as an undergraduate student.

In the "Solution.txt" file, you will find the details of how I created SQL injections for a vulnerable website.                                   
You can experiment with the given files and do it too by running the website locally in your localhost.
